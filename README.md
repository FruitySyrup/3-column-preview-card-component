# Frontend Mentor - 3-column preview card component solution

This is the third challenge I've done.

*Note that I did not have the figma/sketch file to get exact pixels, colors or styles. I did make deviations from the style-guide.md when they did not match the final design.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Another simple challenge. To get the words to fit just like the design doc, I used overflow-wrap which was a first for me. Also has two media queries for smaller screens and moblie.
